[Thelia](https://thelia.net/) is an open source tool for creating e-business websites and managing online content. This software is published under LGPL.

This is the new major version of Thelia.

A repository containing all thelia modules is available at this address : https://github.com/thelia-modules

Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.5
    * Required extensions :
        * PDO_Mysql
        * openssl
        * intl
        * gd
        * curl
        * calendar
        * dom
        * fileinfo
    * safe_mode off
    * memory_limit at least 128M, preferably 256.
    * post\_max\_size 20M
    * upload\_max\_filesize 2M
    * date.timezone must be defined
* Web Server Apache 2 or Nginx
* MySQL 5


### MySQL 5.6

As of MySQL 5.6, default configuration sets the sql_mode value to

```
STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
```

This 'STRICT_TRANS_TABLES' configuration results in SQL errors when no default value is defined on NOT NULL columns and the value is empty or invalid.

You can edit this default config in ` /etc/my.cnf ` and change the sql_mode to remove the STRICT_TRANS_TABLES part

```
[mysqld]
sql_mode=NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
```

Assuming your sql_mode is the default one, you can change the value directly on the run by running the following SQL Command

```sql
SET @@GLOBAL.sql_mode='NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION', @@SESSION.sql_mode='NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION'
```

For more information on sql_mode you can consult the [MySQL doc](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/fr/server-sql-mode.html "sql Mode")

## Archive builders
Thelia's archive builder's needs external libraries.
For zip archives, you need PECL zip. See [PHP Doc](http://php.net/manual/en/zip.installation.php)

For tar archives, you need PECL phar. Moreover, you need to deactivate php.ini option "phar.readonly":

```ini
phar.readonly = Off
```

For tar.bz2 archives, you need tar's dependencies and the extension "bzip2". See [PHP Doc](http://php.net/manual/fr/book.bzip2.php)

For tar.gz archives, you need tar's dependencies and the extension "zlib". See [PHP Doc](http://fr2.php.net/manual/fr/book.zlib.php)

## Download Thelia 2 and install its dependencies

You can get the sources from git and then let composer install dependencies, or use composer to install the whole thelia project into a specific directory

### Using git for download and composer for dependencies

``` bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/thelia/thelia path
$ cd path
$ git checkout 2.3.5 (2.2.6 or 2.1.11)
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install
```

### Using composer for both download and dependencies

``` bash
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar create-project thelia/thelia path/ 2.3.5 (2.2.6 or 2.1.11)
```

If something goes wrong during the install process, you can restart Thelia install wizard with
the following command : `php composer.phar run-script post-create-project-cmd`

## Install it

You can install Thelia by two different way

### Using install wizard

Installing thelia with the web install wizard allow to create an administrator, add some informations about your shop, etc

First of all, you have to configure a vhost as describe in [configuration](http://doc.thelia.net/en/documentation/configuration.html) section.

The install wizard in accessible with your favorite browser :

``` bash
http://yourdomain.tld/[/subdomain_if_needed]/install
```

For example, I have thelia downloaded at https://thelia.net and my vhost is correctly configured, I have to reach this address :

``` bash
https://thelia.net/install
```

### Using cli tools

``` bash
$ php Thelia thelia:install
```

or if you use a Thelia project :

``` bash
$ php composer.phar run-script post-create-project-cmd
```

You just have to follow all instructions.

### Docker and docker compose

This repo contains all the configuration needed to run Thelia with docker and docker-compose.

It requires obviously [docker](https://docker.com/) and [docker-compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/)

To install Thelia within Docker, run :

```
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec web composer install
docker-compose exec web php Thelia thelia:install
```

This will prompt you for database information. Enter the following :

* host : mariaDB
* port : 3306 (default)
* name : thelia
* login : root
* password : toor

tip : create an alias for docker-compose, it's boring to write it all the time

All the scripts can be launched through docker (or the corresponding `docker-compose exec web ...` command. For example :

```
docker exec -it thelia_web_1 composer install
docker exec -it thelia_web_1 php Thelia cache:clear
docker exec -it thelia_web_1 php setup/faker.php
docker exec -it thelia_web_1 unit-tests.sh
```

Once started, you can open your local Thelia website at [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) and your phpMyAdmin installation at [127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081).

What is missing :

* confguration for export compression (zip, gzip, etc)

Obviously you can modify all the configuration for your own case, for example the php version or add environment variable for the database configuration. Each time you modify the configuration, you have to rebuild it :

```
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

Usage
-----

Consult the page : http://localhost/thelia/web/index_dev.php

You can create a virtual host and choose web folder for root directory.

To run tests (phpunit required) :

``` bash
$ phpunit
```

We still have lot of work to achieve but enjoy this part.
